## Course Description
This graduate-level course provides an in-depth exploration of Bayesian statistical methods tailored to applications in political science research. Students will learn the theoretical foundations of Bayesian inference, including prior distributions, likelihood functions, and posterior analysis, as well as practical techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations and hierarchical modeling. The course emphasizes using Bayesian methods for estimating models, making predictions, and dealing with uncertainty in real-world political data. Students will engage with case studies applying Bayesian approaches to electoral behavior, policy analysis, causal inference, and survey data interpretation. Hands-on exercises using statistical software (e.g., R and Stan) will provide students with the skills necessary to implement Bayesian analyses in their research projects. Prerequisites include familiarity with statistical methods and proficiency in R.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the theoretical foundations of Bayesian statistics.
- Solve theoretical problems, prove theorems, and derive estimators tailored to the student’s research interests.
- Combine practical and theoretical knowledge to solve Political Science problems.
- Implement the desired methods in R and Stan.

---

## Target Audience
This course is designed for Political Science graduate students. However, individuals outside the discipline interested in Bayesian statistics may also find this class beneficial.

## Course Details
**Location:** SSB 353  
**Term:** Winter 2025  
**Hours:** Thursday 09:00 – 11:50 AM  
**Credits:** 4  
**Syllabus Version:** 1.0  

---

## Prerequisites
To enroll in this course, students must have completed an introductory graduate-level statistics course focusing on probability theory or an equivalent course. Additionally, students should be willing to put in hard work and attention to detail.

---

## Software
We will use **R** and **Stan**. Some pointers on how to apply the techniques in Python (pymc library) will also be given.

---

## Books and Readings
The leading textbook for the class is:
- **[BDA] Bayesian Data Analysis (3rd edition)** by Gelman et al. ([link](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/))  
  [Errata](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/bda.errata.pdf) | [Solutions to some problems](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/solutions_bda3.pdf)

## Grading and Evaluations

### Assignments
| Assignment       | Weight          | Due Date |
|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Problem Sets x 10 (9% each) | 90% |   |
| Participation x 8 (1.25% each) | 10% |   |

- There will be 11 weekly problem sets. The highest 10 grades will be averaged.
- Participation will be measured by 10 Canvas quizzes. Participation in at least 8 lectures is required for full marks.

**Grading Scheme:**
| Grade         | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| **Check-minus** | Work is unacceptable. It maps to zero points. |
| **Check**      | Work is acceptable but can be improved. Maps to 0.5 points. |
| **Check-plus** | Work is great. Maps to 1 point. |

### Participation
Active participation includes showing up on time, being engaged, asking questions, and contributing meaningfully.

## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is expected of everyone at UC San Diego. Dishonesty undermines learning and certification of abilities. Any violations will be reported to the Academic Integrity Office and may result in sanctions, including failure in the class or suspension. Collaborations are encouraged, but work must be your own.
