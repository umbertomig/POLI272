# POLI 272 - Bayesian Methods

[Dr. Umberto Mignozzetti](https://github.com/umbertomig)

This graduate-level course provides an in-depth exploration of Bayesian statistical methods tailored to applications in political science research. Students will learn the theoretical foundations of Bayesian inference, including prior distributions, likelihood functions, and posterior analysis, as well as practical techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations and hierarchical modeling. The course emphasizes using Bayesian methods for estimating models, making predictions, and dealing with uncertainty in real-world political data. Students will engage with case studies applying Bayesian approaches to electoral behavior, policy analysis, causal inference, and survey data interpretation. Hands-on exercises using statistical software (e.g., R and Stan) will provide students with the skills necessary to implement Bayesian analyses in their research projects. Prerequisites include familiarity with statistical methods and proficiency in R.
